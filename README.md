## 🗂 *Dataset Source:*Heart Disease - UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://share.google/MN20Eph4zcSYbMHCC) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

## 🎯 Objective
Load and explore the Heart Disease dataset
Train a Decision Tree and Random Forest model
Visualize model decisions and evaluate accuracy
Interpret which features impact predictions
Use cross-validation for model validation

## 📘 Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection through data can help save lives. This notebook demonstrates how to use Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict heart disease based on clinical features such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more.

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Cross-validation (5-fold)
- Feature Importance Analysis

#  📌Final Conclusion¶
The Random Forest model clearly outperforms the Decision Tree in terms of accuracy, generalization, and robustness. With a 99% test accuracy and a cross-validation average of 99.7%, it demonstrates excellent predictive power on unseen data.

## 📊 Key insights:

Random Forest shows balanced precision and recall for both classes.
No overfitting was observed, as training and test scores are close.
Top predictive features include: cp (chest pain), ca (major vessels), and thalach (max heart rate).
🔍 This makes Random Forest a strong, reliable model for predicting heart disease based on clinical features.
